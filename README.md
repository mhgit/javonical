Javonical
=========
As a professional freelance programmer I have sat through my fair share of Java technical
tests. They are usually the first step when applying for a role so you have make sure that
you are familiar with what answers are expected. Usually this means digging out some books
and doing some revision. What I have found is that the topics covered are almost always the
same. I've also found that it's really to forget all the areas that can come up.

Javonical is here help. It is the canonical collection of Java technical questions to save
you hunting around lots of sources before that important first interview.

I originally thought I would group together the questions under topics but decided quickly
to drop that in favour of structuring this as if it were an actual interview. I will
annotate the questions to make it clear what is being asked and then provide what should
go into your answer. I will not be trying to give the answers verbatum because that needs
to be in your words.

Enough explanation lets begin.
